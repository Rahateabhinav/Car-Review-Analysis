# Car-Review-Analysis
To deliver a framework that can help the user to select/sort any particular car based on initial reviews of people
As people mostly use the manual process while looking for a car, and it’s not the perfect way they want.
People are not sure what to look, where to look and which one to select?
Testing every car is not possible!
Which car fits my budget?
Unaware of specifics.
